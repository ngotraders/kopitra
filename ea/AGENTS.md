# Expert Advisor Contribution Guide

These instructions govern changes within the `ea` directory.

## Documentation
- Keep all inline comments and documentation in English.

## Required Checks
Before submitting changes under `ea/`, ensure:

- Format modified scripts using MetaEditor auto-formatting so indentation and spacing follow platform conventions.
- Compile the Expert Advisor or library in MetaEditor/MetaTrader to confirm there are no syntax or type errors.
- Execute the relevant strategy tests in MetaTrader to validate behavior before shipping changes.
