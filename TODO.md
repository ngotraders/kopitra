# Project Planning TODO

## Phased Milestones
1. **Phase 1 – Core Copy Trading Pipeline**
   - Stabilize ingestion of master account trade signals with latency budgets under 150 ms.
   - Implement secure credential vaulting and role-based access for broker connections.
   - Deliver a minimal monitoring dashboard covering trade replication health.
2. **Phase 2 – Portfolio Intelligence**
   - Introduce allocation strategies (mirrored lots, proportional risk, and fixed fractional).
   - Layer in configurable risk guards for drawdown, exposure, and trade frequency.
   - Expose performance analytics APIs for downstream reporting tools.
3. **Phase 3 – Ecosystem Integrations**
   - Add broker-specific adapters for priority partners and sandbox providers.
   - Offer webhook and message bus connectors for external automation workflows.
   - Launch developer SDKs and documentation for third-party strategy authors.

## Reliability Tasks
- Instrument trade replication pipeline with distributed tracing and SLO dashboards.
- Build automated failover for strategy hosts with warm standby replicas.
- Implement circuit breakers and dead-letter queues around broker RPC failures.
- Schedule regular disaster-recovery game days to validate runbooks.

## Technical Debt
- Refactor execution engine to isolate broker adapters behind a unified interface.
- Replace ad hoc polling loops with event-driven workers backed by message queues.
- Upgrade configuration management to support per-tenant overrides and secrets.
- Consolidate duplicated trade model validations across services.

## Documentation Backlog
- Author a "Getting Started" guide for copy-trading operators and tenant admins.
- Document broker onboarding procedures, including compliance prerequisites.
- Create reference diagrams for signal flow, scaling topology, and observability stack.
- Maintain an API changelog covering release notes and migration guidance.
