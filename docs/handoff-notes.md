# Integration Harness Handoff Notes

This document summarizes the state of the cross-service copy-trading acceptance work as of the latest iteration.

## Completed Work
- Replaced the management-to-gateway HTTP bridge with a Service Bus emulator and new publisher logic (`functions/src/Kopitra.ManagementApi/Infrastructure/Messaging/Http/HttpServiceBusPublisher.cs`).
- Implemented an in-memory session directory for tracking approved Expert Advisor (EA) sessions (`functions/src/Kopitra.ManagementApi/Infrastructure/Sessions`).
- Added a `CopyTradeGroupBroadcaster` that publishes membership updates to Service Bus (`functions/src/Kopitra.ManagementApi/Infrastructure/CopyTradeGroupBroadcaster.cs`).
- Updated management Functions to use the Service Bus publisher and session directory, removing the former direct Gateway client.
- Introduced a Rust-based Service Bus emulator crate (`servicebus-emulator`) and wired it into `compose.yaml` alongside gateway updates for the new dependency.
- Adjusted the acceptance harness and ops-console integration tests to rely on gateway outbox checks now that the session-summary endpoint is gone.
- Documented the revised setup in `docs/integration-test-plan.md`.

## Work in Progress
- `cargo test --manifest-path tests/acceptance/Cargo.toml --no-run` was compiling when compute budget expired; confirm the build completes successfully.
- Re-run `dotnet build` if any TypeScript helper changes require updated bindings.

## Follow-Up Testing
- Execute the Rust acceptance tests end-to-end (`cargo test --manifest-path tests/acceptance/Cargo.toml`) once the build artifacts are ready.
- Run the ops-console integration suite (`npm run test:integration`) after validating queue paths.

## Known Gaps
- The session directory does not yet clear terminated sessions—add integration coverage and implementation to prevent stale entries.
- The Service Bus emulator lacks retry and duplicate-detection logic; consider stress and performance tests for burst traffic.
- The new HTTP publisher could use unit tests that verify payload formatting and error propagation.

## Environment Notes
- `docker compose` now expects the `servicebus` emulator service; build it locally with `docker compose build servicebus` if images are missing.
- The emulator stores state in memory, so restarting its container clears queued admin messages—acceptable for tests but relevant for long scenarios.
- The acceptance harness depends on gateway outbox endpoints for authentication checks; keep gateway headers stable when iterating.
